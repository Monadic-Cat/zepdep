# Zepdep
This project is a collaboration with [WhistlingZephyr](https://github.com/WhistlingZephyr),
where they
[collected crates.io reverse-dependency data](https://gist.github.com/WhistlingZephyr/7f444e6cf42354925e5b3df75d03de24),
and I processed it into a nested JSON format which directly reflects rdep relationships.
